## About the Project
This project is an **ongoing development** of a **chromatography simulation tool**, aimed at offering an interactive environment to model and visualize various chromatography processes. The goal is to help users understand the mechanics of separation techniques such as liquid chromatography, gas chromatography, and more.

Currently in progress, the program is designed to simulate factors like solvent flow, sample migration, and interactions with different media, providing a visual representation of how different chromatography processes unfold over time.

## Curent progress
- **Interactive Graph Window** with scroll, pan and zoom

## Built in
**Godot 4.3.stable** which allows for great flexibility and cross-platform compatibility
